# 🤖 AutoDev - AI Developer Agent

AutoDev is a modular, AI-powered developer assistant that:
- Reads and understands JIRA tickets
- Analyzes codebases (monorepo or microservices)
- Writes feature code, tests, and documentation
- Builds test environments with Docker
- Submits pull requests with human-readable context

This project is a personal mission to build my own AI teammate. It’s where I document, experiment, and learn how to engineer *with* AI — not just use it.

## 🧠 Why Build This?

Software engineering is more than writing code. It’s planning, understanding architecture, maintaining consistency, and reducing mental overhead.

AutoDev is my attempt to:
- Solve my own developer pain
- Learn the limits of agentic LLMs
- Think like a product builder, not just an implementer
- Create something real I can use — and maybe others too
