**Phase**: Phase 1 - Bootstrap

## âœ… What I Did
- Created Notion structure
- Sketched project roadmap
- Decided on code & note separation

## ðŸ§  Insight
This project feels like the most exciting thing Iâ€™ve done in a while. Not because it's flashy, but because it's real and deeply mine.

## ðŸš§ Challenges
Still unsure if Iâ€™ll use LangChain or build my own agent loop.

## ðŸ”œ Next
- Connect to JIRA API
- Begin extracting ticket data
